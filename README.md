# Bazaar Price Tracker
Check Price Information for any Hypixel Skyblock Item in the Bazaar

## Formatting rules (that could get fixed in the future, but for now you have to follow these)
1. Enchantments have Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), and not Roman Numerals (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X) like minecraft uses
2. You must use the ItemID (which you can search for [here](https://api.slothpixel.me/api/skyblock/items)) or the actual name of the item in-game for it to know what you are talking about
3. You must use spaces between multi-word items if you search for an item with the name, but you can choose between spaces and underscores if searching with ItemIDs (In the case where the ItemID is the same as the actual item name, you can still choose between underscores and spaces)
4. Enchantems must have the word "Enchantment" in front of it
5. Must be specific with the spelling of the item that you are looking for

___Everything___ _else you can think of is possible (unless you find something, then in that case please report it to me)_
